awk, bash scripts and some C to create database for Linux
I have combined other GPL codes to create an AWK and C driven automated database creation thing.
Ensure that the server has MariaDB, phpMyAdmin, GCC (C) and AWK installed.
Set up and enable http deamon, firewall, Apache Web server.
Grab css, jss and font folder from Bootstrap 3 or even Bootstrap 4 - those guys rock. 

The file formtable.txt will be read by the create5script.sh script and a webpage, sql files are autogenrated. Run everything
from /var/www/html folder. Use phpMyAdmin to build the entries for MariaDB. k

I will have to find the original author of some of these codes and make sure he/she gets the credit they deserve - I just
mangled it and scripted it and wrote some simple C.
